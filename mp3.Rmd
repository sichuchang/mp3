Q:Is is true that older movies tended to fit squarely in one genre, while more recent movies tend to span multiple genres?

```{r}
#Find the film has how many genres in each year from 1874 to 2017
film_genre = film_before_2017%>%
   group_by(id,production_year)%>%
   summarise(sum = n_distinct(info))%>%
   arrange(production_year)
film_genre



```

```{r}

```




```{r}
# we define the film with more than 3 genres as the film with multilple genres and 
# find out how many films has more than 3 genres in each year from 1874 to 2017
multi_genre_film = 
  film_genre %>% 
  filter(sum >= 3) %>% #want the films with overlapping genres (more than 3)
  group_by(production_year) %>% 
  summarise(multi_num = n_distinct(id))

multi_genre_film
```



```{r}
#Find the average of the number of film's genres from 1874 to 2017
film_genre_avg = 
film_genre %>%
  group_by(production_year) %>% 
  summarise(avg_genre = mean(sum))

film_genre_avg
# the data seems like the avg doesn't change that much... (not what we expect...)

```


```{r}
#How many different genres appear in each year from 1874 to 2017 
info_type_year = film_before_2017%>%
  group_by(production_year)%>%
  summarise(sum = n_distinct(info))%>% #how many different genres each year
  arrange(production_year)
info_type_year


# from the data we can see that the number of distinct genres increases by years
